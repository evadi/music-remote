# Music Remote
============

## Introduction
A Chrome Extension which allows you to remotely control Google Play Music running in a Chrome tab. Appearing as a **panel** window type, the remote control
sits in your taskbar allowing quick and easy control over the music you have playing, no matter what application you are working with at the time.

If you are lucky enough to have media keys (or have mapped your keyboard keys to control music) you can use these to control your music without the need to
have Google Play Music as the active tab.
